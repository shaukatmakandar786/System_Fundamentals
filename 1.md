# 1)What is Computer?

A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it 
with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It renders output just after 
performing mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can 
process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from 
the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.

A computer is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions through 
integrated hardware and software components. It works with the help of programs and represents 
the decimal numbers through a string of binary digits. It also has a memory that stores 
the data, programs, and result of processing. The components of a computer such as machinery 
that includes wires, transistors, circuits, hard disk are called hardware. 
Whereas, the programs and data are called software.

eg:   
1.laptop computer  
2.desktop computer  
3.server computer  
4.calculator  
5.mobile etc  


# 2)Types of software:  

	1.Application Software  
	2.System software  
  
  
  1.Application Software:  

	Application software is commonly defined as any program or number of programs designed 
	for end-users.
	eg:   
	1.MS-Office  
	2.media player  
	3.paint  
	4.calculator etc.  

2.System software:  

	System software is a software that provides platform to other softwares. Some examples can 
	be operating systems, antivirus softwares, disk formating softwares, Computer language 
	translators etc. These are commonly prepared by the computer manufacturers. 
	These softwares consists of programs written in low-level languages, used to interact with 
	the hardware at a very basic level. System software serves as the interface between the hardware 
	and the end users.  


The most important features of system software include :  

1. Closeness to the system  
2. Fast speed  
3. Difficult to manipulate  
4. Written in low level language  
5. Difficult to design  


# 3)What is an Operating System:  

	An operating system (OS) is a type of system software that manages computer’s hardware 
	and software resources. It provides common services for computer programs. 
	An OS acts a link between the software and the hardware. 
	It controls and keeps a record of the execution of all other programs that are present in
	the computer, including application programs and other system software.



The most important tasks performed by the operating system are:  

1. Memory Management: The OS keeps track of the primary memory and allocates the memory when a process requests it.
2. Processor Management: Allocates the main memory (RAM) to a process and de-allocates it when it is no longer required.
3. File Management: Allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides who gets the resources.
4. Security: Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means of passwords.
5. Error-detecting Aids: Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting methods.
6. Scheduling: The OS schedules process through its scheduling algorithms.


# 4)Types of operating system:  

1. Batch Operating System –  
2. Time-Sharing Operating Systems –  
3. Distributed Operating System –  
4. Network Operating System –  
5. Real-Time Operating System –  
	a)Hard Real-Time Systems:  
	b)Soft Real-Time Systems:  


1. Batch Operating System :  

	This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly. 
	There is an operator which takes similar jobs having same requirement and
	 group them into batches. It is the responsibility of operator to sort the jobs with similar needs.


Advantages of Batch Operating System:  

It is very difficult to guess or know the time required by any job to complete. Processors of the batch systems know how long the job would be when it is in queue
Multiple users can share the batch systems
The idle time for batch system is very less
It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems

Disadvantages of Batch Operating System:  

The computer operators should be well known with batch systems
Batch systems are hard to debug
It is sometime costly
The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails

Examples of Batch based Operating System: Payroll System, Bank Statements etc.  

2. Time-Sharing Operating Systems :  

	Each task is given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly.
	Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system. These systems are also 
	known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from single user or from different 
	users also. The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time 
	interval is over OS switches over to next task.


Advantages of Time-Sharing OS:  

Each task gets an equal opportunity
Less chances of duplication of software
CPU idle time can be reduced

Disadvantages of Time-Sharing OS:  

Reliability problem
One must have to take care of security and integrity of user programs and data
Data communication problem  

Examples of Time-Sharing OSs are: Multics, Unix etc.  



3. Distributed Operating System:  

	These types of operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer technology 
	and are being widely accepted all-over the world and, that too, with a great pace. Various 
	autonomous interconnected computers communicate each other using a shared communication 
	network. Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU. These are referred as 
	loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. These system’s processors differ in size and function. 
	The major benefit of working with these types of operating system is that it is always possible that one 
	user can access the files or software which are not actually present on his system but on some other 
	system connected within this network i.e., remote access is enabled within the devices connected in 
	that network.
 

Advantages of Distributed Operating System:  

Failure of one will not affect the other network communication, as all systems are independent from each other
Electronic mail increases the data exchange speed
Since resources are being shared, computation is highly fast and durable
Load on host computer reduces
These systems are easily scalable as many systems can be easily added to the network
Delay in data processing reduces

Disadvantages of Distributed Operating System:  

Failure of the main network will stop the entire communication
To establish distributed systems the language which are used are not well defined yet
These types of systems are not readily available as they are very expensive. 
Not only that the underlying software is highly complex and not understood well yet  

Examples of Distributed Operating System are- LOCUS etc.


4. Network Operating System :  

	These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, 
applications, and other networking functions. These type of operating systems allow shared access of files, 
printers, security, applications, and other networking functions over a small private network. One more important 
aspect of Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well aware of the underlying configuration, 
of all other users within the network, their individual connections etc. and that’s why these computers are 
popularly known as tightly coupled systems.


Advantages of Network Operating System:  

Highly stable centralized servers  
Security concerns are handled through servers  
New technologies and hardware up-gradation are easily integrated to the system  
Server access are possible remotely from different locations and types of systems  

Disadvantages of Network Operating System:  

Servers are costly  
User has to depend on central location for most operations  
Maintenance and updates are required regularly  

Examples of Network Operating System are: Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, 
UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD etc.  



5. Real-Time Operating System :  
	
	Real-time systems are used when there are time requirements are very strict like missile
	systems, air traffic control systems, robots etc.

Two types of Real-Time Operating System which are as follows:  

Hard Real-Time Systems:  

These OSs are meant for the applications where time constraints are very strict and even the shortest 
possible delay is not acceptable. These systems are built for saving life like automatic parachutes or 
air bags which are required to be readily available in case of any accident. Virtual memory is almost never 
found in these systems.

Soft Real-Time Systems:  

These OSs are for applications where for time-constraint is less strict.
