# 11)What is Linux?

Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn?t function.

# 12)Diffrence between Linux and Unix

1	Development:	Linux is open source and is developed by Linux community of developers.	  
			Unix was developed by AT&T Bell labs and is not open source.  
2	Cost		Linux is free to use.	  
			Unix is licensed OS.  
3	Supportd File systems	Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, Jfs, ReiserFS, Xfs, Btrfs, FAT, FAT32, NTFS.	  
				fs, gpfs, hfs, hfs+, ufs, xfs, zfs.  
4	GUI		Linux uses KDE and Gnome. Other GUI supported are LXDE, Xfce, Unity, Mate.	  
			Unix was initially a command based OS. Most of the unix distributions now have Gnome.  
5	Usage		Linux is used in wide varieties from desktop, servers, smartphones to mainframes.  
			Unix is mostly used on servers, workstations or PCs.  
6	Default Shell	Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is default shell for Linux.	  
			Bourne Shell is default shell for Unix.  
7	Target processor	Linux was initially developed for Intel's x86 hardware processors.  
				Now it supports 20+ processor families.	  
				CUnix supports PA-RISC and Itanium family.  
				
8	Example			Ubuntu, Debian GNU, Arch Linux, etc.	  	
				SunOS, Solaris, SCO UNIX, AIX, HP/UX, ULTRIX etc.

# 13)Types of usres in linux:

## The root user account:
This is the main user account in Linux system. It is automatically created during the installation. It has the highest privilege in system. It can do any administrative work and can access any service. This account is intended for system administration and should be used only for this purpose. It should not be used for routine activities. It can’t be deleted. But if require, it can be disabled.  

## The regular user account:
This is the normal user account. During the installation, one regular user account is created automatically. After the installation, we can create as many regular user accounts as we need. This account has moderate privilege. This account is intended for routine works. It can perform only the tasks for which it is allowed and can access only those files and services for which it is authorized. As per requirement, it can be disabled or deleted.  

## The service account:
Service accounts are created by installation packages when they are installed. These accounts are used by services to run processes and execute functions. These accounts are neither intended nor should be used for routine work.

# 14)What is Virtualization:  

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or virtual, representation of something, such as virtual applications, servers, storage and networks. It is the single most effective way to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses.

## HOW VIRTUALIZATION WORKS:

Due to the limitations of x86 servers, many IT organizations must deploy multiple servers, each operating at a fraction of their capacity, to keep pace with today’s high storage and processing demands. The result: huge inefficiencies and excessive operating costs.

Enter virtualization. Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system. This enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system – and multiple operating systems and applications – on a single server.
The resulting benefits include economies of scale and greater efficiency.

## Key Properties of Virtual Machines:

### Partitioning:

Run multiple operating systems on one physical machine.
Divide system resources between virtual machines.  

### Isolation:  

Provide fault and security isolation at the hardware level.
Preserve performance with advanced resource controls.  

### Encapsulation:  

Save the entire state of a virtual machine to files.
Move and copy virtual machines as easily as moving and copying files.  

### Hardware Independence:  

Provision or migrate any virtual machine to any physical server.

# 15)Types of Virtualization:  

## 1. Desktop Virtualization:  

This type of virtualization also known as VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) was in our operating system will be running like a virtual machine on a server along with other VD (virtual desktops). For the processing of these VD’s, we will be doing it in a data center with the help of physical servers. The multiple applications and operating systems that are being used by the end-user will be cached in the memory on the server. As of today couple of major virtualization vendors are Citrix and VMware Horizon, these vendors provide a very smooth performance on the virtual machine that the end-user would not realize he is working in one, and they are the widely used applications in the current industry.

## 2. Application Virtualization:  

In this type of virtualization we use software to make our application as a single executable file that can be run anywhere, this software will be segregated from our OS and we will run it in a sandbox. Application virtualization can further be divided into two categories they are:

Remote: In this type of application virtualization, the client will be using a display protocol that is remote for the purpose of communicating to the client machine. One of the advantages of this type of virtualization is that, because it is being used widely it is easy for setting up displays for various applications.
Streaming: The beauty of this kind of application virtualization is that we will be able to have a copy of the app on our server and we can have them run parallel in the local systems of client, so because of this upgrading, the application becomes much easier as the client will always point to the latest version.
A few examples of application virtualization are Xenapp, VM Thinapp, and Zenworks, etc.

## 3. Server Virtualization:  

In this type of virtualization, we aim to virtualize the server that we use, that is we will be running multiple VM’s (virtual machines) in a single physical server. Here the resource form this physical server will be shared among all the virtual servers that are being used. Some of the resources which are being shared majorly are CPU, Storage, ROM, and RAM, etc and we will be sharing them on the hypervisor (a layer of software between the base hardware and the virtual machines). These virtual machines are isolated and independent of each other and they are completely capable of running the different OS in different machines. Some of the competitive vendors that are available in the market who do this server virtualization are vsphere (VMware), Xenserver (Citrix) and Hyper-V (Microsoft), etc.  

## 4. Storage Virtualization:  

Storage virtualization basically combines/pools the storage that is available in various devices and keeps it as single storage. Identification of the available storage is done by leveraging the software and aggregates them to use it in a virtual system/environment. The software actually constantly monitors the various I/O requests from any virtual/physical system and it intercepts them and sends it to the appropriate location where the combined storages are maintained in a virtual environment. This technique of storage virtualization actually helps the administrator for any recovery or backup or archival of data in an effective and efficient manner by taking comparatively less time than the usual. Some of the advantages of this kind of virtualization are:

Our data does not get compromised easily even if the host fails as we store our data in a different and convenient place.
It is easy for us to protect, provide and use our data as we implement some level of abstraction in our storage
Additional functions such as recovery, duplication, replication, etc. can be done with ease  

## 5. Network Virtualization:  

Here we will be using software to decouple the virtual network form the baseline and it will perform the functionality of a network. After we have started using this network virtualization then we will be using the physical network for the sole purpose to forward the packets and we will be doing the management work using the software. We basically collect the entire network and with the help of the routing table we will manage it in real-time and they are also independent of each other. One example of network virtualization is that VPN i.e. virtual private network with the help of this anybody can create a network for them virtually in the internet. If we are providing network virtualization (NV) to one system we will call it internal and if we are combining them in a virtual network we call it as external NV.  

# 16)Hypervisor:  

Hypervisor is a form of virtualization software used in Cloud hosting to divide and allocate the resources on various pieces of hardware.The program which provide partitioning, isolation or abstraction is called virtualization hypervisor. Hypervisor is a hardware virtualization technique that allows multiple guest operating systems (OS) to run on a single host system at the same time. A hypervisor is sometimes also called a virtual machine manager(VMM).

## Types of Hypervisor:

### TYPE-1 Hypervisor:  

Hypervisor runs directly on underlying host system.It is also known as “Native Hypervisor” or “Bare metal hypervisor”.It dose not require any base server operating system.It has direct access to hardware resources.Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Citrix XenServer and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.  

### TYPE-2 Hypervisor:
A Host operating system runs on undrlying host system.It is also known as ‘Hosted Hypervisor”.Basically a software installed on an operating system.Hypervisor asks operating system to make hardware calls.Example of Type 2 hypervisor include VMware Player or Parallels Desktop. Hosted hypervisors are often found on endpoints like PCs.
