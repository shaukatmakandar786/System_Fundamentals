# Process:  

A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion.  
A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system.  

To put it in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes 
a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.

When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections ─ stack, heap, text and data. 
The following image shows a simplified layout of a process inside main memory −

|  S.N. |  Component & Description                                                     |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1   |  Stack:                                                                      |
|       |       The process Stack contains the temporary data such as method/function  |
|       |       parameters, return address and local variables.                        | 
|   2   |  Heap:                                                                       |

## Process Life Cycle:  

When a process executes, it passes through different states. These stages may differ in different operating systems, and the names of these states are also not standardized.

In general, a process can have one of the following five states at a time.

1	
Start

This is the initial state when a process is first started/created.

2	
Ready

The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor. Ready processes are waiting to have the processor allocated to them by the operating system so that they can run. Process may come into this state after Start state or while running it by but interrupted by the scheduler to assign CPU to some other process.

3	
Running

Once the process has been assigned to a processor by the OS scheduler, the process state is set to running and the processor executes its instructions.

4	
Waiting

Process moves into the waiting state if it needs to wait for a resource, such as waiting for user input, or waiting for a file to become available.

## Process Control Block (PCB):  

A Process Control Block is a data structure maintained by the Operating System for every process. The PCB is identified by an integer process ID (PID). A PCB keeps all the information needed to keep track of a process as listed below in the table −


1	
Process State

The current state of the process i.e., whether it is ready, running, waiting, or whatever.

2	
Process privileges

This is required to allow/disallow access to system resources.

3	
Process ID

Unique identification for each of the process in the operating system.

4	
Pointer

A pointer to parent process.

5	
Program Counter

Program Counter is a pointer to the address of the next instruction to be executed for this process.

6	
CPU registers

Various CPU registers where process need to be stored for execution for running state.

7	
CPU Scheduling Information

Process priority and other scheduling information which is required to schedule the process.

8	
Memory management information

This includes the information of page table, memory limits, Segment table depending on memory used by the operating system.

9	
Accounting information

This includes the amount of CPU used for process execution, time limits, execution ID etc.

10	
IO status information

This includes a list of I/O devices allocated to the process.

The architecture of a PCB is completely dependent on Operating System and may contain different information in different operating systems. Here is a simplified diagram of a PCB −



5	
Terminated or Exit

Once the process finishes its execution, or it is terminated by the operating system, it is moved to the terminated state where it waits to be removed from main memory.

The PCB is maintained for a process throughout its lifetime, and is deleted once the process terminates.  

# What is Kernel in Operating System:  

A Kernel is a computer program that is the heart and core of an Operating System. Since the Operating System has control over the system so, the Kernel also has control over everything in the system. It is the most important part of an Operating System. Whenever a system starts, the Kernel is the first program that is loaded after the bootloader because the Kernel has to handle the rest of the thing of the system for the Operating System. The Kernel remains in the memory until the Operating System is shut-down.

The Kernel is responsible for low-level tasks such as disk management, memory management, task management, etc. It provides an interface between the user and the hardware components of the system. When a process makes a request to the Kernel, then it is called System Call.

A Kernel is provided with a protected Kernel Space which is a separate area of memory and this area is not accessible by other application programs. So, the code of the Kernel is loaded into this protected Kernel Space. Apart from this, the memory used by other applications is called the User Space. As these are two different spaces in the memory, so communication between them is a bit slower.

## Functions of a Kernel:  

Following are the functions of a Kernel:

### Access Computer resource:
A Kernel can access various computer resources like the CPU, I/O devices and other resources. It acts as a bridge between the user and the resources of the system.   

### Resource Management: 
It is the duty of a Kernel to share the resources between various process in such a way that there is uniform access to the resources by every process.  

### Memory Management:
Every process needs some memory space. So, memory must be allocated and deallocated for its execution. All these memory management is done by a Kernel.  

###Device Management:
The peripheral devices connected in the system are used by the processes. So, the allocation of these devices is managed by the Kernel.  

## Kernel Mode and User Mode:  

There are certain instructions that need to be executed by Kernel only. So, the CPU executes these instructions in the Kernel Mode only. For example, memory management should be done in Kernel-Mode only. While in the User Mode, the CPU executes the processes that are given by the user in the User Space.  

# what is Thread?  

A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.

A thread shares with its peer threads few information like code segment, data segment and open files. When one thread alters a code segment memory item, all other threads see that.

A thread is also called a lightweight process. Threads provide a way to improve application performance through parallelism. Threads represent a software approach to improving performance of operating system by reducing the overhead thread is equivalent to a classical process.

Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control. Threads have been successfully used in implementing network servers and web server. They also provide a suitable foundation for parallel execution of applications on shared memory multiprocessors. The following figure shows the working of a single-threaded and a multithreaded process.

# Difference between Process and Thread:  

|S.N.|	Process |	Thread |
|----|----------|--------|
|1   |	Process is heavy weight or resource intensive.|	Thread is light weight, taking lesser resources than a process.|
|2	 |Process switching needs interaction with operating system.|	Thread switching does not need to interact with operating system.|
|3	 |In multiple processing environments, each process executes the same code but has its own memory and file resources.|	All threads       can share same set of open files, child processes.|
|4	 |If one process is blocked, then no other process can execute until the first process is unblocked.|	While one thread is blocked and waiting, a second thread in the same task can run.|
|5	 |Multiple processes without using threads use more resources.|	Multiple threaded processes use fewer resources.|
|6	 |In multiple processes each process operates independently of the others.|	One thread can read, write or change another thread's data.|  

## Advantages of Thread:

Threads minimize the context switching time.  
Use of threads provides concurrency within a process.  
Efficient communication.  
It is more economical to create and context switch threads.  
Threads allow utilization of multiprocessor architectures to a greater scale and efficiency.
